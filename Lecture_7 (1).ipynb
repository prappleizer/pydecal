Methods are functions specific to classes. When classes are initialized, it is an instance of that specific class. In the last lecture we created a planet class. We can make modify this slightly to be a classes for stars\n"

Inheriting from it sets our class up so that we can use all of the tools available to an object in python. Subclasses inherit the properties from their super class and have more specified methods and attributes. Perhaps a more clear example is that of pets. One might have a general class that describes pets but might have subclasses of the pet class for dogs, cats, ferrets etc. to assign information and methods that are more specifically associated with each.\n",

The forces between them are determined by their charges and separation and their accelerations are determined by their masses. The bodies will accelerate towards or away from each other dependent on their properties. However, if we want to make an accurate model, we want one which has an adjusts the forces felt between the objects in small enough time steps that we can simulate what might happen in real life.
